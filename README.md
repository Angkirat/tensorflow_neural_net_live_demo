# tensorflow_neural_net_live_demo
This is the code for the 'Tensorflow Neural Network' Live session by @Sirajology on Youtube

##Overview

This is a short script that creates a convolutional neural network using Tensorflow to classify handwritten character digits. The dataset is called [MNIST]((http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)).

##Dependencies

* Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html)
* future (pip install future) 

##Demo

Run the following in terminal and it will train on the MNIST digits, then test its classification accuracy on the provided test digit images.

``python demo.py``

##Credits

The credits for this code go to Aymeric Damien. I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
